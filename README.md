# geneVa

geneVa extends the existing MoVE algorithm (https://github.com/LMSE/move/tree/master/MoVE) for the computation of genetic intervention strategies consisting of static knockouts and metabolic valves.

## what's new

geneVa uses the field **gpr_rules** of cobra-models to **extend the network with gene-protein-reaction associations**. On the extended network, gene-based interventions can be computed in the same way as before reaction based intervention strategies. Hence, it is possible to find solutions that require **gene-KOs, gene-valves, reaction-KOs and/or reaction-valves** (e.g. interruption of the oxygen supply). GPRÂ rules are compressed to some extend before they are integrated in the network. The extended network is again compressed with state-of-the-art techniques provided by CellNetAnalyzer. 

In contrast to MoVE, geneVa **only requires the CellNetAnalyzer** framework. The cobra-toolbox is not needed.

The setups in the example scripts are (mostly) identical to those presented in the MoVE repository.

# Setup

CellNetAnalyzer requires additions to both java and matlab path to run. Firstly, in the script CNAPATH\startcna.m (CNAPATH is the directory where your CNA code is) the two following variables need to be set accordingly:

cplex_matlab_path= 'CPLEXROOT\cplex\matlab\OS'; % CPLEXROOT is the directory where you have installed cplex, OS varies depending on your computer version
cplex_jar_file= 'CPLEXROOT\cplex\lib\cplex.jar';

This startcna.m script has to be run whenever matlab is started. It is also run as part of the geneVa_startup.m script.

Secondly, you have to add the cplex shared library to java.library.path. First locate the file librarypath.txt shown below.

	MATLAB\version\toolbox\local\librarypath.txt	(MATLAB is the directory where Matlab is installed)
	
Then make a copy of this text file to your desktop and open it. Add a line at the end of the file:

	CPLEXROOT\cplex\bin\OS	

Then copy this file back to its original location and override the original. This change will not take place until Matlab is restarted.

To test if the connections are properly setup, run setup_cplex_inner_class_access() (after having called starcna). If no errors are thrown, then your paths have been properly setup.

Finally, set the paths in geneVa_startup.m according to your installation and run this script to start up everything.
